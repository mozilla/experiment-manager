# Mozilla Experimenter Nimbus UI

## Development

- `yarn start` to start the app in development mode on `http://localhost:3000`
- `yarn build` to create a production build
- `yarn test` to run unit tests, or `yarn test --coverage` to see coverage details

## Testing

This package uses [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) to test its code. By default `yarn test` will test all JS/TS files under `src/`.

Test specific tests with the following commands:

```bash
# Test for the component AppLayout
yarn test AppLayout

# Grep for "renders as expected"
yarn test -t="renders as expected"
```

Refer to Jest's [CLI documentation](https://jestjs.io/docs/en/cli) for more advanced test configuration.
