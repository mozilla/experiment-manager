  <h4><span class="fas fa-info-circle"></span> Objectives &amp; Analysis</h4>
  <p>
    The objective of your experiment is the thing you are trying to measure or learn
    by doing the experiment.
  </p>
  <p>
    The analysis plan is how you will use metrics to satisfy that objective.
  </p>
  <p>
    Describe both in detail here.
