Hello,

This is an automatic email from Experimenter about {{ experiment.name }}
{{ experiment.experiment_url }}, which went live on {{ experiment.start_date }}.
Experimenter updates the proposed start date to the actual start date when
the state changes to "Live". The subsequent scheduled change dates
(ex: enrollment pause and experiment end) are recalculated based on
the actual start date.

Please watch your scheduled change dates as the data starts being gathered.
If you need scheduling changes (ex: delay enrollment pause, delay end),
please SLACK: #ask-experimenter. If everything looks good, no action is needed.

Thank you!
Experimenter and Normandy Teams
