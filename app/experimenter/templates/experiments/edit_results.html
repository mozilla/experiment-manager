  <h4><span class="fas fa-info-circle"></span> Results</h4>

  <p>
    All experiments have results.
    Even an experiment not working is a result.
    Result details help people find the artifacts created from
    experiment analysis.  They also help us identify trends, so
    we can focus our resources on impactful experiments and
    addressing the most common issues.
